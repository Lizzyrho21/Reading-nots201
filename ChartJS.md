## chartJS

Chart JS is a way to add dynamic charts and tables to your Javascript page. It pairs with  HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page!

We must download the Chart.js plugin and must be downloaded to use.

## Using the  canvas API
The canvas element in HTML is used to create graphics and animations for your page.

This is the syntax for it:
< canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></ canvas >

Here, we have a canvas element with an ID. we have been using the id for manipulation our DOM.

You can use a fallback => 'alt' just like you would use in an img tag to give the computer an alternative if the  main canvas element. However, the we MUST close the canvas tag unlike the img tag.
